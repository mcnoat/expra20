necessary:
* save fav_letter in file --> read in that file
  * create a placeholder file at the beginning
* tell participant about target letter
* implement letter attractiveness rating
* expand on confusability task
* SONA integration
* adjust instructions for confusability task

would make a big difference:
* check whether each trial has a name attribute
* encode numbers for the Rosenberg answers
  * pay attention to reversed in answer
* add debriefing
  * ...about subject code
  * ...about real purpose of letter attractiveness

nice to have:
* export stimuli generation to an external file (to make code cleaner)
