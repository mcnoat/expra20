necessary:
* randomize order of distractors
* SONA integration
* Is data being saved on the server?
* think through experiment --> Is all the important information being saved?
* finalization: don't show data at the end

would make a big difference:
* test block with non-letter
* improve instructions for the different parts
* check whether each trial has a name attribute
* encode numbers for the Rosenberg answers
  * pay attention to reversed in answer
* add debriefing
  * ...about subject code
  * ...about real purpose of letter attractiveness

nice to have:
* export stimuli generation to an external file (to make code cleaner)
